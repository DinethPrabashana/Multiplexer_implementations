## Introduction to Verilog

Verilog is a hardware description language (HDL) used for designing and simulating digital circuits. It enables efficient hardware design by describing electronic systems, from simple logic gates to complex integrated circuits.

### Key Features:
- **Modularity**: Allows for the modular design of circuits, enhancing reusability.
- **Simulation**: Facilitates simulation and verification of digital designs.
- **Synthesis**: Supports synthesis into hardware implementations, such as ASICs and FPGAs.

### Example:
```verilog
module AndGate(input a, b, output y);
    assign y = a & b;
endmodule
