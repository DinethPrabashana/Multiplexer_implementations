# Multiplexer Implementation

This repository provides three main methods for implementing a Multiplexer:

1. [Behavioral](Multiplexer_implementation/Behavioral)
2. [Gate Level](./GateLevel)
3. [Dataflow Level](./Dataflow)

Each directory contains the Verilog code and testbenches for its respective implementation.
